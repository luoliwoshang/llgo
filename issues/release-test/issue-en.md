# Issue: LLGO Release Testing Mechanism Improvement

## Problem Description

The current LLGO release process has the following issues:

1. **Post-release unavailability** - Released versions may have runtime issues that weren't sufficiently validated before release
2. **Lack of PR validation** - GoReleaser builds are only triggered when creating Git tags, making it impossible to validate builds during PR stage
3. **High release risk** - Build configuration issues are only exposed during actual releases, affecting the release process

## Current Status Analysis

### Existing Workflow Triggers
```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags: ["*"]           # Only triggered on tag pushes
```

**Current Problem**: Builds are only triggered when creating Git tags, making it impossible to validate build configurations during development

### Desired Workflow Triggers
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: ["**"]      # Trigger on every branch push
    tags: ["*"]           # Including tag pushes
  pull_request:
    branches: ["**"]      # Trigger on every PR
```

**Purpose**: Ensure every code change goes through complete build and test validation, guaranteeing PR quality

### Current GoReleaser Command
```bash
goreleaser release --clean --skip nfpm,snapcraft
```

**Problem**: This command directly publishes to GitHub Releases without testing.

## Desired Build Workflow Design

We want to implement a safer release process:

### Stage 1: Build Verification
1. **Trigger Build** - Tag push triggers goreleaser
2. **Build All Platforms** - Execute `goreleaser release --skip=publish,nfpm,snapcraft`
3. **Save Build Artifacts** - Upload `dist/` directory to GitHub Artifacts

### Stage 2: Automated Testing
4. **Matrix Parallel Testing** - Start multiple test jobs, one for each platform
   - macOS x86_64 test job
   - macOS ARM64 test job  
   - Linux x86_64 test job
   - Linux ARM64 test job

5. **Download and Test** - Each test job:
   - Downloads corresponding platform build artifacts
   - Extracts and runs corresponding demo programs
   - Verifies basic functionality works correctly

### Stage 3: Release Decision
6. **Wait for All Tests** - Only when all 4 platform tests pass
7. **Conditional Release Logic** - Check trigger event type:
   - **If tag push event** → Execute official release to GitHub Releases
   - **If regular push/PR event** → Output test results and finish, no release

### Benefits
- ✅ **Every Change Validated** - Every push/PR goes through complete build testing
- ✅ **Guaranteed PR Quality** - Discover potential issues before merging
- ✅ **Safe Releases** - Only tested tags get published
- ✅ **Early Problem Detection** - Discover platform-specific issues before release
- ✅ **Automated Validation** - Reduce manual testing workload
- ✅ **Fast Failure Recovery** - Failed tests prevent releasing broken versions
