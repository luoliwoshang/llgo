# Issue: LLGO Release Testing Mechanism Improvement

## Problem Description

The current LLGO release process has the following issues:

1. **Post-release unavailability** - Released versions may have runtime issues that weren't sufficiently validated before release
2. **Lack of PR validation** - GoReleaser builds are only triggered when creating Git tags, making it impossible to validate builds during PR stage
3. **High release risk** - Build configuration issues are only exposed during actual releases, affecting the release process

## Current Status Analysis

### Existing Workflow Triggers
```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags: ["*"]           # Only triggered on tag pushes
```

**Current Problem**: Builds are only triggered when creating Git tags, making it impossible to validate build configurations during development

### Current GoReleaser Command
```bash
goreleaser release --clean --skip nfpm,snapcraft
```

**Problem**: This command directly publishes to GitHub Releases, which would cause accidental releases if executed on PR/push!
